# demonstration-epub
These are all projects I worked on for Digital Publishing and Production at Ryerson. This course was my first time learning any type of code, and so it was a bit of a challenge. I mostly created html docs, and then eventually moved into editing, fixing, and creating epubs. My goal for all my projects was to make them as readable as possible, and for the later epubs, adding in accessibility features was a big focus.

If you'd like to view any of my epubs, download the .epub file and then use this <a href="https://www.fviewer.com/view-epub"> link </a> to view the final product.
